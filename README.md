- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunnyyshc
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems that makes people happier. (i.e. whether that is a game for fun or automating things so users can do sth more valuable, etc.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, data science, NLP, computer vision and app development.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything I can contribute really.
